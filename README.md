# Air_Plane_System_OOP
This is a mini project in my "Introduction to Programming" course at VinUniversity. Specifically, I have to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts to design and implement a simplified airline reservation system.


Classes to Include:

-Flight: Represents a flight with attributes like flight number, destination, departure time, available seats, etc.

-Passenger: Represents a passenger with details such as name, age, and passport number.

-Reservation: Manages reservations, linking passengers with specific flights.

-AirlineSystem: Acts as the main class to handle operations like adding flights, managing reservations, and displaying flight/passenger details.



Functionalities to Implement:

-Add a Flight: Create a new flight with details like flight number, destination, departure time, and total seats.

-Book a Seat: Allow a passenger to reserve a seat on a specific flight. Ensure the seat is available before confirming the reservation.

-Cancel a Reservation: Allow a passenger to cancel their reservation. Update the flightâ€™s available seats accordingly.

-View Flight Details: Display flight details, including reserved and available seats.
-View Passenger Details: Display a list of passengers on a specific flight.
